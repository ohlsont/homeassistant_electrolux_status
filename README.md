## Prerequisites

All devices need configured and Alias set in the Electrolux app prior to configuration.
If this does not occur the home assistant integration may raise an authentication error depending on device type and region such as:

- My Electrolux Care/My AEG Care (EMEA region)
- Electrolux Kitchen/AEG Kitchen (EMEA region)
- Electrolux Life (APAC region)
- Electrolux Home+ (LATAM region)
- Electrolux Oven/Frigidaire 2.0 (NA region)

## Installation

_If the integration does not appear add a new repository in HACS manually: `https://github.com/albaintor/homeassistant_electrolux_status`_

1. Search for `Electrolux Status` in HACS.
2. Click install.
3. In the HA UI go to `Configuration` -> `Integrations` and search for `Electrolux Status`.
4. Insert your Electrolux credentials ( You can test the credentials in https://developer.electrolux.one/login)

**Known issues :**

- This integration is based on new APIs and may be unstable
- Some commands don't work (to be investigated) : several dropdown lists like setting analog temperature...
- Upstream API does not currently support `language`
- Issues with authentication, if the integration can't start and you see a "403 forbidden" error in the logs, there is a workaround : try to login to the website of your appliance (eg aeg.fr, aeg.nl, electrolux...) with the account and password from the app. If the website reports that the password is wrong : change it using "forgot password" link and try again to configure the integration

Maybe changing the password through the aeg-website into your app-password can help you as well?

### Supported and tested devices

This list is non-exhaustive and your appliance may work even if not present here


**Fridge**

| Manufacturer | Model     | Description            |

| ELECTROLUX   | EHE6899SA | 609L UltimateTaste 900 |

**Induction Hob**

| :----------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| AEG          | CCE84779CB | 8000 ComboHob, with integrated extractor    |

Hobs are supported by appliance type (`HB`), so other Wi-Fi hobs are likely to
work even though only the model above has been verified on real hardware. Hob
zones are discovered from the appliance itself, so bridged and flexible zones
appear automatically.

Cooking zone power, running time, residual heat and pot detection are exposed
read-only. The integrated extractor is controllable: fan speed, manual/automatic
mode, hob-to-hood level and run-on duration. Cooking controls are deliberately
not writable, see `custom_components/electrolux_status/catalog_hob.py`.
